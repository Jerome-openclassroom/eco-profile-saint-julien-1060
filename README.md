# 🌿 Eco-Profile: Saint-Julien Chapteuil 1060 m (Haute-Loire, France)

This repository documents a detailed eco-climatological inventory of a 1-hectare site located at 1060 m elevation, in the eastern foothills of the Massif Central. The project blends field observations from 2017–2018 with interdisciplinary scientific interpretation: climatology, botany, fauna, and instrumental meteorology.

## 📍 Location & Context

- **Nearest village**: Saint-Julien-Chapteuil (860 m)
- **Elevation**: 1060 m, above typical winter inversion layers
- **Terrain**: Semi-natural bocage meadow, near stream, beech-fir forest and volcanic features
- **Soil**: Granite-basalt substrate, slightly acidic to neutral pH, oligotrophic
- **Surrounding forest type**: Mixed beech-fir forest (*Fagus sylvatica* and *Abies alba*) — typical of mid-elevation montane zones, providing shade, organic matter, and ecological corridors.

## 🌦️ Climatic Data

### Sources
- **Manual observations** (2017–2018): daily rainfall and weather notes
- **Supplementary temperature data**: Mazet-Saint-Voy station (12 km, same elevation) source : https://www.infoclimat.fr

### Notable Events
- Summer 2017: storms (up to 38 mm in 24h)
- September 21st 2017: early frost
- October 2017: dry (20 mm), gusts up to 76 km/h
- Mean temperature estimate: ~8.5°C; frequent frost; strong day/night amplitude

## 🌿 Floristic Inventory (April–May 2018)

| Date       | Species |
|------------|---------|
| April 25   | Ficaria verna, Taraxacum officinale, Glechoma hederacea |
| May 11     | Prunella vulgaris, Saxifraga granulata, Silene dioica, Myosotis sylvatica, Conium maculatum |
| May 12     | Ranunculus repens |

**Features**: Vernal plants, mesophilic indicators, transitional humid-lisière habitats

## 🐾 Fauna Observed

- **Mammals**: roe deer, hares, wild boar, foxes, moles, bats.
- **Birds**: red kite, owls (undetermined)
- **Herpetofauna**: amphibians, vipers or grass snakes
- **Small mammals**: voles
- **Insects**: zygoptera, anisoptera, probable hummingbird hawk-moth

**Additionnal note :**
Confirmed presence of the fox (*Vulpes vulpes*) and reported presence of the wolf (*Canis lupus*) indicate that the site supports a fully functional trophic chain, from microfauna to top predators. This highlights the value of the surrounding forest-prairie mosaic as a corridor and refuge for species requiring large, connected habitats.

## 🔬 Soil Microfauna (Berlèse Funnel Extraction)

Three specimens were extracted from leaf litter collected in the adjacent mixed beech–fir forest. A Berlèse funnel was used to isolate the microarthropods, which were then imaged under a stereomicroscope using digiscoping with a millimetric grid for scale reference (note: slight shape deformation may occur due to alcohol preservation).

- **Collembola.JPG** — Typical Collembola (springtail), abundant in moist organic layers.
- **Oribatida.JPG** — Oribatid mite, indicative of active litter decomposition.
- **Pseudoscorpionida.JPG** — Pseudoscorpion, small predatory arthropod, marker of well-balanced soil biodiversity.

This microfaunal set provides a snapshot of soil ecosystem health and trophic interactions in semi-natural montane litter.

## 🧠 Scientific Purpose

This site illustrates a high-altitude microclimate and ecosystem in transition between Mediterranean, Atlantic, and montane influences.

### Goals:
- Foster **high-resolution citizen science**
- Serve as input to **environment-aware AI or AGI systems**
- Demonstrate **fieldwork competence beyond institutional frameworks**

## 📁 Repository Contents

- `/data`: raw Excel datasets (climate, observations)
- `/figures`: diagrams, climate visuals
- `/microfauna`: 3 specimens
- `README.md`: this document

**Average Daily Temperature (1991–2021)**

This plot shows the average daily temperature for the site, computed over the standard climatological period (1991–2021).  
It provides a robust thermal baseline to complement the personal rainfall data and field observations.  
Seasonal patterns clearly highlight the typical cold winters, moderate springs, and warm summers with frequent thunderstorms characteristic of Haute-Loire’s mid-mountain climate.
